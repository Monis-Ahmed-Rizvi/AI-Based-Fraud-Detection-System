# Enterprise AI Application Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the development of a full-stack, AI-driven web application inspired by C3 AI's enterprise solutions. It showcases the ability to build scalable, AI-powered applications for various industries, focusing on reliability, fraud detection, sensor network health, supply network optimization, energy management, anti-money laundering, and customer engagement.

## Technologies
- Frontend: React, Redux
- Backend: Python
- Database: SQL (PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB)
- AI/ML: TensorFlow, PyTorch
- Cloud Deployment: AWS, Azure, or GCP
- Version Control: Git

## Features
1. AI-driven analytics dashboard
2. Real-time data processing and visualization
3. Predictive maintenance module
4. Anomaly detection for fraud prevention
5. Energy optimization algorithms
6. Supply chain optimization toolkit
7. Customer engagement prediction model

## Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up the database (instructions in `database_setup.md`)
4. Configure cloud services (AWS/Azure/GCP credentials)
5. Run the application:
   ```
   python app.py
   npm start
   ```

## Project Structure
